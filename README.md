 Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to Factor Integers
A Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm that is used to factor numbers. The usual case for quantum supremacy being Shorâ€™s Algorithm is a guaranteed factor of an Integer, n. 
In our heuristic, the answer generated is the approximate answer close to n with all of the factors.
